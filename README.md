RPG built in RPG Maker MV.
Magic is primarily a minor force, used for little more than simple quality of life. No need to carry a watering can if you have water magic, after all.
A way to 'become stronger' has been found- some people have gained spirits known as "Patrons," manifestations of their own superego, that can change how their magic works and how powerful it is. These Patrons are only visible to those their person is open toward, and certainly seem to have a mind of their own. And... the only way to obtain a Patron is through trauma.
This story follows a very young adult and their patron, simply trying to find a friend and happiness in a world that seeks to use them.


Heavy symbolism, use of horror themes as a storytelling technique.

Inspired by games such as Deltarune, Lobotomy Corporation, Library of Ruina, OMORI, and OneShot.
